spine-runtime-monogame
======================

Originally this was a complete runtime for using Esoteric Software's Spine with MonoGame - developed because the XNA runtime was not yet available.

However the official XNA runtime is now available!  Therefore this repository is much smaller and just contains a demo iOS application.

If you want to run this then you'll need MonoGame (https://github.com/mono/MonoGame) and also the xamarin-ios projects from the monogame branch of my fork of the spine-runtimes (https://github.com/RandolphBurt/spine-runtime-monogame/tree/monogame)
 
Have fun :)
